# First Ideas

- Mensch ärgere dich nicht
  - Power Up on the field
  - Different pieces have different skills

- Pong/Breakout
  - Collect Power UPs
  - Paddle/Ball Masks each Mask gives different abilities
  - Ball === Wrestler collecting Masks=powerups
  - After a "round" choose between two masks/abilities

- Chicken/Racoon Invaders
  - Racoon vs Cotton Candy
  - Bullethell with Masks as Power UPs
  - Skins/Masks for different animals
